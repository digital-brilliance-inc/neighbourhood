              Weâ€™re looking for a few people to act as Storytellers for the Church in Milton who can help to spread the
              word as the Kingdom grows in our neighbourhoods and churches. As is the case for everything we do at
              Milton.Church, we want to do this in a relationally connecting way.{' '}

            <p>If this sounds like a fit for you, please reach out and let us know!</p>
